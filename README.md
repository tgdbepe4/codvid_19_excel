# codvid_19_excel

##Pre
There are serveral dashboard available to refelct the current state of the current covid-19 desease. For Switzerland a minimum of three.All are base on the ESRI Arcgis server. Influence of the presentation of the data is for an end user not possible.

##Idea
I was wondering if an MS Excel version or any other local programm implementation could show more or less the same but with the great advantage of local work on the representation of the graphs and data.
